Floating Static Route - Tasks
1. On R1, configure floating default route such as:
   All traffic will be sent first to IP address on G0/0 of R2
   Only if the link on subnet 192.168.1.0/24 went down, then all traffic should be re-route to IP address on G0/1 of R2
2. On R2, configure floating static route such as:
   All traffic destined for loopback 1 on R1 will be sent first to IP address on G0/1 of R1
   Only if the link on subnet 192.168.2.0/24 went down, then all traffic should be re-route to IP address on G0/0 of R1
