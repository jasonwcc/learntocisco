Configure ACL and NAT
1. All traffic sent from 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.7 will be translated using NAT on R2. 
2. All addresses must be translated to the IP address of Gig0/1 on R2, while only using a standard access list named NAT.
3. On R2, configure another ACL using number 10 permitting only IP address of Gig0/1 to be sent out to subnet 192.168.2.0/24





Answer:
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 ip nat inside

!
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
 ip nat outside
 ip access-group 10 out
!
ip nat inside source list NAT interface GigabitEthernet0/1 overload
!
ip access-list standard NAT
 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.7
access-list 10 permit host 192.168.2.1
